# MERN Auth Practice üöÄ

Welcome to MERN Auth Practice! This project is a manifestation of my learning journey in MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack development, with a special focus on authentication. It's a practice ground, where I've distilled the essentials of user registration, email verification, forgot password, change password, and multi-factor authentication into a simple, hands-on learning experience. üõ°Ô∏èüîê

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to dive deep into several key aspects:

- **MERN Stack Development**: Gained hands-on experience in building applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
- **User Authentication**: Explored and implemented secure user authentication processes.
- **Email Verification**: Practiced enhancing account security through email verification.
- **Forgot Password Functionality**: Implemented password reset functionality via email.
